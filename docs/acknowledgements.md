We started with the idea of creating a tool to standardize all the commands of the different projects years ago, when most of the `lume` maintenance team was working in the Galician research center, [Gradiant](https://github.com/Gradiant). 
There, we developed the wonderful `bowie` package.
We know that this package is still active in several internal projects of the research center, so long live `bowie` and thanks to the Gradiant team for the initial impulse.
