## What is lume?

A handy Python-based automation tool. It can be thought of as a vitaminized `Makefile`. 

## How could lume help me?

`lume` helps you sort your commands, allows you to abstract from the development environment and facilitates CI and CD workflows.
Use the `lume.yml` to define all your daily project commands. 

## Installation 💻

``` bash
pip install lume
```

## Acknowledgements 🙌

`bowie` inspired us! 👨‍🎤 👏👏👏👏👏
We started with this idea of creating a tool to standardize all the commands of the different projects in the [Gradiant](https://github.com/Gradiant) research center, through the development of the wonderful `bowie` package.
We know that the project is still active in several projects, so long live bowie and thanks to the Gradiant team for the initial impulse.
